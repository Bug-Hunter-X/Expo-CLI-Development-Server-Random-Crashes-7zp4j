To address the random crashes, a multi-pronged approach was used:

1. **Enhanced Logging:** Added more verbose logging statements within the Expo CLI's internal components to capture additional context in the event of a crash.  This involved modifying the core Expo modules, which is generally not recommended but was necessary for better diagnostic information.

2. **Resource Monitoring:** Utilized system monitoring tools to observe resource usage (CPU, memory) during development to determine if there are resource exhaustion issues. If memory usage was consistently high leading up to crashes, it might indicate a memory leak within the application code.

3. **Dependency Review:**  Checked for outdated or conflicting dependencies in the `package.json`.  Updating Expo CLI and related packages often resolves subtle compatibility issues that can manifest as random crashes.

4. **Clean Build:**  Tried deleting the `.expo` and `node_modules` directories before running `npm install` again. This helps eliminate potential build artifacts that could contribute to server instability.

5. **Platform Specific Issues:** Examined the platform-specific logs to identify OS-related errors, especially on Windows and macOS which have unique system requirements.

While no definitive fix is always possible for random crashes, these solutions provide several directions to improve stability and diagnostics, guiding developers to a more specific root cause if one exists.  Remember to commit changes after exploring each step and restart the development server each time.
